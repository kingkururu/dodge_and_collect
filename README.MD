This is a standard dodge and collect game. You have 5 hearts each, which will decrement by 1 when you hit a rain and by 3 when you get hit by a lightning bolt. 
Your aim is to hit as many coins as possible before you die. 1 coin equals 100 points. 

Lightning bolts and rains get re-spawned by decreasing time intervals. Good luck!
